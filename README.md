in the repository.

1- 2D path operators
====================

This code was written in 2004 initially by Benjamin Appleton and Hugues Talbot, 
while at CSIRO Mathematical and Imaging Sciences. Ben was a PhD student at 
University of Queensland and Hugues was his advisor. 

It relies on the ImageMagick library for I/O.
