morphological_path_operators
============================

ABSTRACT:

This repository contains code and documentation for morphological path operators, 
which are non-linear filters useful in image analysis and image processing

Created 2014-03-13

Path operators are filters from mathematical morphology suitable for the
filtering, enhancement, detection and segmentation of thin objects. Some 
examples are given in the repository.

1- 2D path operators
====================

This code was initially written in 2004 initially by Benjamin Appleton and Hugues Talbot, 
while at CSIRO Mathematical and Imaging Sciences. Ben was a PhD student at 
University of Queensland and Hugues was his advisor. 

It relies on the ImageMagick library for I/O.

4- Misc
======

Python and Matlab bindings, tutorial code, applications. To be announced.
